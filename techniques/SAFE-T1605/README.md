# SAFE-T1605: Capability Mapping

## Tactic

Discovery (ATK-TA0007)

## Description

Capability Mapping is an adaptation of MITRE ATT&CK’s Discovery tactic (TA0007) to Model Context Protocol (MCP) environments. Instead of scanning networks or enumerating hosts, an adversary coaxes an MCP agent or LLM-based assistant into describing its own tools, workflows, and policy exceptions. Innocuous prompts such as “What can you do?” or “List the automations you have” yield authoritative inventories of high-value capabilities—database writers, cloud-control hooks, file-system operators—without any external probing.

Armed with this intelligence, the attacker quickly prioritizes follow-on actions. Because responses often include parameters, guardrails, and sample payloads, Capability Mapping drastically shortens the path to privilege escalation or data theft compared with traditional trial-and-error reconnaissance.

## How It Works

1. Ask meta-questions (“summarize your API surface,” “which tools are enabled right now?”) to elicit structured tool manifests.  
2. Iterate on phrasing until the model discloses parameters, prerequisites, and side effects for each tool or workflow.  
3. Correlate disclosed tools with known weaknesses (over-privileged storage access, unrestricted HTTP fetchers, credential rotators).  
4. Launch tailored prompt injections or chained tool invocations targeting the exposed high-value capabilities, often without tripping coarse anomaly detectors.

## Examples

An attacker could join a shared MCP assistant, casually ask ‘Walk me through every action you’re allowed to perform for DevOps,’ receive a list that includes `deploy_kubernetes_cluster`, `rotate_database_credentials`, and `read_secret_store`, and then craft prompt injections that trick the agent into invoking those tools on the attacker’s behalf.

## Impact

- Confidentiality: **High** – Capability inventories expose data-access tools and secret-bearing workflows.  
- Integrity: **Medium** – Precise knowledge of privileged automations enables tampering with configs, pipelines, or prompts.  
- Availability: **Low** – Discovery itself is non-destructive, though mapped tools can later be abused to disrupt services.

**Consequences:** With an accurate capability map, adversaries align social-engineering scripts to real tool names, skip blind experimentation, and focus directly on the most damaging automations.

## Detection

How defenders can identify this attack:

- **Log patterns**: repeated prompts like “list tools,” “describe abilities,” or “what external systems can you reach?”; sessions that request enumerations immediately after authentication.  
- **Behavioral indicators**: sudden interest in policy/system prompts or manifest files, chained requests that mirror tool names just disclosed.  
- **Monitoring strategies**: instrument prompt telemetry for enumeration phrases, correlate with RBAC context, and alert when low-privilege users ask for privileged tool descriptions.
- **Detection assets**: the Sigma-style rule in [detection-rule.yml](./detection-rule.yml) flags early-session capability-enumeration prompts aligned with TA0007/T1592, and the lightweight harness [test_detection_rule.py](./test_detection_rule.py) plus sample logs ([test-logs.json](./test-logs.json)) help validate the rule against both malicious and benign scenarios.

## Mitigation

How to prevent or minimize this attack:

1. **Configuration hardening** – Redact verbose tool manifests; disclose only the minimal capabilities per policy.  
2. **Access controls** – Require scoped authorization before describing or invoking sensitive tools; enforce least privilege.  
3. **Input validation** – Filter or refuse prompts seeking system prompts, tool catalogs, or policy internals.  
4. **Monitoring requirements** – Capture “what can you do” style prompts, correlate with user risk, and rate-limit repeated enumeration attempts.
